coalesce()

To avoid full shuffling of data we use coalesce() function. In coalesce() we use existing partition so that less data is shuffled. Using this we can cut the number of the partition. Suppose, we have four nodes and we want only two nodes. Then the data of extra nodes will be kept onto nodes which we kept.
